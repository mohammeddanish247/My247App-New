This plugin requires "View controller-based status bar appearance" (UIViewControllerBasedStatusBarAppearance) set to YES in Info.plist. Read about Configuring iOS for help.

The status bar visibility defaults to visible and the style defaults to Style.Default. You can change these defaults by adding UIStatusBarHidden and/or UIStatusBarStyle in Info.plist.

setBackgroundColor and setOverlaysWebView are currently not supported on iOS devices.
